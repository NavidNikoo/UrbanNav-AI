# UrbanNav-Ai ðŸš—ðŸ§   
**AI Pathfinding Simulator for Self-Driving Cars**

UrbanNav-Ai is an AI visualization tool built with Python and Pygame that simulates how autonomous vehicles navigate grid-based environments using advanced search algorithms. It compares A*, Uniform Cost Search, and Iterative Deepening on 2D maps with real-time visual feedback, traffic rules, and adaptive heuristics.

---

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- Visualizes:
  - A* Search (with Manhattan & Euclidean heuristics)
  - Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
  - Iterative Deepening (IDS)
- "Learn" mode: adapt A* heuristic based on feedback from optimal paths
- Interactive 2D grid environment:
  - Set start/goal positions
  - Add walls (obstacles)
  - Add stop signs ðŸš« and traffic lights ðŸš¦ with weighted traversal costs
- Real-time stats: execution time, memory usage, explored nodes
- PNG-based UI for clean macOS compatibility
- Designed with autonomous car routing logic in mind

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goal

To bring search algorithms to life â€” not just in theory, but in practical, visual, and interactive ways that mimic the decision-making of self-driving vehicles navigating city traffic.
